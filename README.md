Then the Admin side is to allow the employer see the waiters availability for a particular day. It also allow them to clear the list for a new week update.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

# Prerequisites
Things you need to install and how to install them.
 - NodeJS,
 - ExpressJs,
 - Express-midlewares
 - Npm dependencies
 - MongoDB,
 - Mongoose
 - Heroku,

# Installation
A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running.
- Step1

Depending on your OS running in your machine,
First in your command prompt, run
`node -v` you should see something like:
`v8.3.0`, depending on your version, if you see nothing [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) to install nodejs:

Next install(npm dependencies)

- [Express.Js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express): ```$ npm install --save express```
- [body-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser):```$ npm install body-parser```
- [express-flash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-flash): ```npm install git://github.com/RGBboy/express-flash.git```
- [express-handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars):```$ npm install express-handlebars```
- [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session): ```$ npm install express-session```
- [express-flash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-flash): ```npm install git://github.com/RGBboy/express-flash.git```
- [session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session): ```$ npm install express-session```
  You also need to store the data in a database using:
- [MongoDB](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-secure-mongodb-on-ubuntu-16-04)

  And the following link explains to you on how to: 'How To Connect Node.js to a MongoDB Database' click [Here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-connect-node-js-to-a-mongodb-database-on-a-vps)
- [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/), This will help you to store and retrieve data on MongoDB.
You will deploy your Web Application using heroku, itâ€™s a PaaS (Platform as a Service) - it provides a platform as a place (service) where you can easily deploy your web applications using git. click on heroku to follow the steps.
- [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-nodejs).

Here is how my package.json looks after doing all the above.
This should look almost the same to yours.

# Running the app locally.
Assume that you already did all the above steps.
Now inside your command prompt(Terminal for Ubuntu user)go inside your root directory and type `cd(current directory)` inside your project directory.
once you are in type `index.js`
The output should like this inside your command prompt:

`App runnig on http://localhost:5000
   Database ready to be used...!`
  Now inside the browser type: `http://localhost:5000`
  your app should be ready and running.(Grap a cap of... and celebrate your success.)
