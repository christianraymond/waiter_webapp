# Waiter web app.
Waiter App is a website that enables a Restaurant or a Hotel owners to get waiters online. Waiters can access the site, input theirs names, and select the days they would preffere to work. Then the Admin side is to allow the employer see the waiters availability for a particular day. It also allow them to clear the list for a new week update.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing
purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

Clone this [Repositoy](https://github.com/christianraymond/waiter_webapp), copy and past:
`git clone https://github.com/christianraymond/waiter_webapp` inside your project folder.

# Prerequisites
Things you need to install and how to install them.
 - NodeJS,
 - ExpressJs,
 - Express-midlewares
 - Npm dependencies
 - MongoDB,
 - Mongoose
 - Heroku,

# Installation
A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running.
- Step1

Depending on your OS running in your machine,
First in your command prompt, run
`node -v` you should see something like:
`v8.3.0`, depending on your version, if you see nothing [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) to install nodejs:

Next install(npm dependencies)

- [Express.Js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express): ```$ npm install --save express```
- [body-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser):```$ npm install body-parser```
- [express-flash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-flash): ```npm install git://github.com/RGBboy/express-flash.git```
- [express-handlebars](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-handlebars):```$ npm install express-handlebars```
- [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session): ```$ npm install express-session```
- [express-flash](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-flash): ```npm install git://github.com/RGBboy/express-flash.git```
- [session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session): ```$ npm install express-session```
  You also need to store the data in a database using:
- [MongoDB](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-secure-mongodb-on-ubuntu-16-04)

  And the following link explains to you on how to: 'How To Connect Node.js to a MongoDB Database' click [Here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-connect-node-js-to-a-mongodb-database-on-a-vps)
- [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/), This will help you to store and retrieve data on MongoDB.
You will deploy your Web Application using heroku, itâ€™s a PaaS (Platform as a Service) - it provides a platform as a place (service) where you can easily deploy your web applications using git. click on heroku to follow the steps.
- [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-nodejs).

Here is how my package.json looks after doing all the above.
This should look almost the same to yours.

` {
  "dependencies":
    "body-parser": "^1.17.2",
    "express": "^4.15.4",
    "express-flash": "0.0.2",
    "express-handlebars": "^3.0.0",
    "express-session": "^1.15.5",
    "flash": "^1.1.0",
    "flash-express": "^1.0.4",
    "heroku": "^0.2.0",
    "mongoose": "^4.11.10",
    "nodemon": "^1.12.0",
    "session": "^0.1.0"
}`

# Running the app locally.
Assume that you already did all the above steps.
Now inside your command prompt(Terminal for Ubuntu user)go inside your root directory and type `cd(current directory)` inside your project directory.
once you are in type `index.js`
The output should like this inside your command prompt:

```App runnig on http://localhost:5000```
   ``Database ready to be used...!```

  Now inside the browser type: ```http://localhost:5000```
  your app should be ready and running.
  (Grap a cap of... and celebrate your success.)
  don't forget to press Ctr + c to stop the server.

# How to create the app from scratch.

 inside your Terminal type:
 `mkdir + the name of your project`,
 `cd``` in the project using this command `cd + the name of the directory your created`,
 Your can also type `pwd` to make sure in the right directory or folder.
 Once you are in type `npm init -y` this will generate or create your express app.
  output should look something like this:

    ```{
  "name": "readme",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```
From there you can start creating the file ender your folder name and start your ExpressJs app.
[Click](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html)this link to get some hint on how to star your express app if you are getting stuck.

# Deploying to Github
 Assume you created a Github account.
Inside your project folder type:
  `git init`
  `git commit -m 'write your comment here'`
  `git push -u origin master`
- NB
For the first time push to the branch master your need to copy and the paste the
`git add remote + the url containing your repo name`

# Deploying to Heroku
Assume that you have:
Node.js and npm installed.
an existing Node.js app.
a free Heroku account.
the Heroku CLI.

Type these commands.
```$ heroku create
Creating pure-citadel-24793 ... done, stack is cedar
http://arcane-lowlands-8408.herokuapp.com/ | git@heroku.com:arcane-lowlands-8408.git
Git remote heroku added
$ git push heroku master
...
-----> Node.js app detected
...
-----> Launching... done
       https://pure-citadel-24793.herokuapp.com/ deployed to Heroku```

And then the following.
`$ git add ,
$ git commit -m "Added a Procfile.",
$ heroku login
Enter your Heroku credentials.`   

Then start your app locally using heroku local command which is installed as a part of the Heroku CLI.
$ heroku local web Your app should now be running on http://localhost:5000/.
