    Hello, Thank you for visiting this site.
    First, let me tell you how it works, 'Click on waiters bar on the top, then In the Url, you type in the name that wants to book the days to work, then press Enter.'
    From there the magic happens, you will be redirected to the days of the week and start selecting your preferred working days of your choice.
    Sounds interesting right?, Let's try it.
